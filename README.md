# 🤖 Rube Goldberg Form – Creative HTML Form

This is a fun and whimsical HTML form designed to resemble a **Rube Goldberg machine**. Instead of a standard web form, this project uses illustrations of pulleys, gears, hands, and objects interacting in a visually clever way to simulate the process of submitting a form.

- ✅ Checkbox to agree to terms (humorously labeled "agree to whatever")
- 🖱️ Unique submit button activated through a Rube Goldberg-like sequence
- 🧩 Purely HTML/CSS-based structure (with optional JavaScript for functionality)
- 🎭 Visually playful UI that's great for portfolio/showcase

## 🛠 Tech Stack
